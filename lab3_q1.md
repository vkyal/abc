# **Markdown**
***
The markdown syntax is a way of **structuring** documents and providing styling without having to use **HTML** or **Cascading Style Sheets.** The name is the play on the term *markup,* which is the process of preparing documents for printing through the process of editing and layout.

# **Features of GitHub Markdown**
[x] **Simple, symbolic syntax**
[x] **Compatible with HTML for additional rendering**
[x] **Automatically rendered in GitHub**
[x] **Allow for Repository information documents**

# **Common GitHub Markdown Text Directives**
**Directive**|**Use**|**Example**
:---|:---|:---
\*|Italic|*Italic*
\*\*|Bold|**Bold**
\~\~|Strikethrough|~~Strikethrough~~
\`\`|Command|`Command`
\\|Escape Characters|\* Two asterisks \*

You can tell GitHub to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using `\` before the Markdown character.

`Lets's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*.`
